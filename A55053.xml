            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And what too soon would dye, help to destroy; as if the cares of Humane life were few, we seek out new, And follow Fate, which will too fast pursue. In vain does Natures bounteous hand suppy what pevish Mortals to themselves deny. See how, on ev'ry bough the Birds express in their wild Notes, their happiness: Not anxious, how to get or spare, they on their Mother Nature lay their care. Why then should Man, the Lord of all below, such troubles chuse to know, as none of all his subjects undergo? </p>

Through the World I wander night and day, to find my stragling Senses, in an angry mood I met Old Time with his Pentateuch of Tenses; when me he spies, away he flies, for Time will stay for no man; in vain with cryes, I rend the Skies, for Pity is not common. Cold and comfortless I lye, Help, help, oh help, or else I dye! Hark, I hear <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Team, the Carman 'gins to whistle; Chast <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a╌na</hi> bends her Bow, and the Boar begins to bristle. Come <hi>Vulcan</hi> with Tools and with Tackles, to knock off my troublesome shackles: Bid <hi>Charles</hi> make ready his Wain, to bring me my Senses a╌gain.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Third Book, or Collection of New Ayres and Songs had come to your hands some Months sooner, had I not been prevented by long Sickness; however I hope it will not now be unwelcome. I need not here commend the Excellency of their Composition, the ingenious Authors Names being printed with them, who are Men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to make <hi>English</hi> Words speak their true and genuine Sence both in good humour and Ayre; which can never be performed by either <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> they not so well understanding the Proprieties of our Speech. I have seen lately published a large Volum of <hi>English</hi> Songs, composed by an <hi>Italian</hi> Master, who has lived here in <hi>England</hi> many Years; I confess he is a very able Master, but being not perfect in the true <hi>Idiom</hi> of our Language, you will find the Air of his Musick so much after his Country-Mode, that it would sute far better with <hi>Italian</hi> than <hi>English</hi> Words. But I shall forbear to censure his Work, leaving it to the Verdict of better Musical Judgments; only I think him very disingenious and much to blame, to endeavour to raise a Reputation to himself and Book, by disparaging and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing most of the best <hi>English</hi> Masters and Professors of Musick. I am sorry it is (in this Age) so much the Vanity of some of our <hi>English</hi> Gentry to admire that in a Foreigner, which they either slight, or take little notice of in one of their own Nation; for I am sure that our <hi>English</hi> Masters in Musick (either for Vocal or Instrumental Musick) are not in Skill and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inferiour to any Foreigners whatsoever, the same Rules in this Science being generally used all over <hi>Europe:</hi> But I have too far digress'd, and therefore beg your Pardon This Book being bound up with the two others formerly published, will make a compleat Volum. To conclude, I desire you to think, that I have herein as much studied your satisfaction as my own Interest, and kindly to receive this Collection, from</p>

Most of the Songs have had the Approbation of (and are composed by) the best Masters in <hi>Musick,</hi> so that my Commendation can add little to their Value: However it is probable some ignorant Persons may unjustly censure them, like a certain Pretender to Musick, (who boasted himself a Scholar of Mr. <hi>Birchenshaw</hi>'s) who publickly declar'd, That in my last Book there was but three good Songs, the rest being worse than common Ballads sung about Streets by Foot-boys and Link-boys; but (as <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest of Men, has it) the <hi>way</hi> of a Fool is <hi>right</hi> in his own Eyes, and he that <hi>despiseth</hi> his Neighbour is <hi>void</hi> of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> As for such Gentlemen who really understand Musick, I doubt not but they will give this, as they have done the former, a better reception; and that to them it will appear, that my Design is more the public Good, than my own private Gain.

This I conceive I was bound to let my Reader understand; and that in what hitherto I have made public of this nature, my pains and care has ever been not only to procure perfect Copies, but also to see them true and well printed: But now I find my Age, and the Infirmities of Nature, will not allow me the strength to undergo my former Labours again, I shall leave it to two young Men, my own Son, and Mr. <hi>Carr</hi>'s Son, who is one of His Majesty's Musick, and an ingenious person, whom you may rely upon, that what they publish of this nature, shall be carefully corrected and well done, my self engaging to be assisting to them in the overseeing the Press for the future, that what Songs they make public be good and true Musick, both for the credit of the Authors, and to the content and satisfaction of the Buyers; which that they may never be otherwise, is the desire of,</p>
